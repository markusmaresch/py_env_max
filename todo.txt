Next Steps:
    - update all
      create list of updates per level
      restore point
      check valid version of list with pip list
      update with pip install (possibly in batches)
      verify with pip check
      roll back or commit
      unwind restore point

    - yml/templates: yml/templates/<os>/conda_3.9.yml
    - yml_export (for server update)
    - implement updates
        get latest releases (with cached delay)
        for all out of date:
            search for limitation of new version via pipdeptree.json
            try installation - can still fail due to new dependencies
        # for
        pip check
            -> fail, try to roll back
        read all back in, if sucessful

Later:
    - fix version, Version, NormalizedVersion

Optimization:
    - tree: often, key and package_name are identical, remove one if same
