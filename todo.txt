Next Steps:
    - yml_empty_templates: yml_templates/<os>/conda_3.9.yml
    - yml_export (for server update)
    - cmd_export (bat/sh)
    - implement updates
        get latest releases (with cached delay)
        for all out of date:
            search for limitation of new version via pipdeptree.json
            try installation - can still fail due to new dependencies
        # for
        pip check
            -> fail, try to roll back
        read all back in, if sucessful

Later:
    - fix version, Version, NormalizedVersion

Optimization:
    - tree: often, key and package_name are identical, remove one if same
