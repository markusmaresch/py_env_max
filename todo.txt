Next steps:
    - resolve PRE_INSTALL NO_CACHE_DIR, levels ...
    - resolve LOCKED - all known in pipdeptree.json -> include this in database and use for updates
    - implement updates
        get latest releases (with cached delay)
        for all out of date:
            search for limitation of new version via pipdeptree.json
            try installation - can still fail due to new dependencies
        # for
        pip check
            -> fail, try to roll back
        read all back in, if sucessful
