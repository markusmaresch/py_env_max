Next Steps:
    - update all:
    -   issue installing some NEW version, which requires NEW dependencies, that are not checked
        -> even reverting fails
        example:
            upd_all: py_env_202202.tmp .. 1/1: 4: imbalanced-learn: 0.9.1 .. attempt to update (from 0.8.0)
            upd_all: Successfully uninstalled scikit-learn-1.0.2
            upd_all: Successfully uninstalled imbalanced-learn-0.8.0
            upd_all: Successfully installed imbalanced-learn-0.9.1 scikit-learn-1.1.1
            upd_all: ERROR: pip's dependency resolver does not currently take into account all the packages that are installed. This behaviour is the source of the following dependency conflicts.
            upd_all: recommenders 1.1.0 requires scikit-learn<1.0.3,>=0.22.1, but you have scikit-learn 1.1.1 which is incompatible.
            upd_all: Successfully uninstalled imbalanced-learn-0.9.1
            upd_all: Successfully installed imbalanced-learn-0.8.0
            upd_all: py_env_202202.tmp .. 1/1: 4: imbalanced-learn: 0.8.0 .. revert succeeded: WRONG

    - releases_recent: some are not updated with respect to python 3.9, only 3.8 - this can be checked in the URLs
        example: box2d, 2.3.10

    - yml/templates: yml/templates/<os>/conda_3.9.yml
    - yml_export (for server update)
    - implement updates
        get latest releases (with cached delay)
        for all out of date:
            search for limitation of new version via pipdeptree.json
            try installation - can still fail due to new dependencies
        # for
        pip check
            -> fail, try to roll back
        read all back in, if sucessful

Later:
    - fix version, Version, NormalizedVersion

Optimization:
    - tree: often, key and package_name are identical, remove one if same
