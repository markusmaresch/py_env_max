Update All
    use: --dry-run before trying and react to that, instead if try/rollback (reason objc..)

Features:
    Install new packages: a=1.0 b=2.0 c=3.0 .. or form of requirements
        Use --dry-run, attempt and roll back if not sucessful
        Parse: Would install x1==2.6.0 x2==4.21.7
            If more than one -> danger

    Example:
        pip install --dry-run pywhatkit
        # triggers several others - try to install one by one
        # Would install
        ## MouseInfo-0.1.3     .. splits into 3 .. recurse
        ## PyAutoGUI-0.9.53    .. splits into 9 .. recurse
        ## PyGetWindow-0.0.9   .. splits into 2 .. recurse
        ## PyMsgBox-1.0.9      .. works 0
        ## PyRect-0.2.0        .. works 0
        ## PyScreeze-0.1.28    .. works 0
        ## pyperclip-1.8.2     .. works 0
        ## pytweening-1.0.4    .. works 0
        ## rubicon-objc-0.4.2  .. works 0
        ## wikipedia-1.4.0     .. works 0
        ## pywhatkit-5.4
        put above in a list, which original target last
        scan log for 'Uninstalling'
        put them into a list, and try one by one

Bugs
    * when collecting releases_recent, it seems to keep 10.
        Of those all could be 'a' or 'b' releases, so we need to keep more or back until we get a good release
    * remove yanked releases from releases_recent list


Address topic of moving environment from Windows -> Linux, ...

replace with call, add os:
    env_cmd.py:256:        db_name = '{}.json'.format(env_name)
    env_cmd.py:286:        db_name = '{}.json'.format(env_name)
    req_cmd.py:19:        db_name = '{}.json'.format(env_name)
    scripts_cmd.py:13:        db_name = '{}.json'.format(env_name)
    statistics.py:13:        db_name = '{}.json'.format(env_name)

Also:
    consider flag in requirements
        a==1.2.3 ; sys_platform == "win32"  # flag those internally
        b==4.5.6 ; sys_platform != 'darwin'

Next Steps:
    - need to split JSONs by OS, then add transfer, merge and so on ...
    - update all:
    -   issue installing some NEW version, which requires NEW dependencies, that are not checked
    - yml/templates: yml/templates/<os>/conda_3.9.yml
    - yml_export (for server update)

Find secondary orphans / PRUNE
    reproduce: install tensorflow, then uninstall
    look at: tensorflow-estimator, tensorflow-io-gcs-filesystem
    have: required_by: tensorflow, which does not exist any more

Add -package -uninstall X, Y, Z
    also remove all, that are only required_by X, Y, Z
