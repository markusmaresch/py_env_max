    * remove yanked releases from releases_recent list


Address topic of moving environment from Windows -> Linux, ...

replace with call, add os:
    env_cmd.py:256:        db_name = '{}.json'.format(env_name)
    env_cmd.py:286:        db_name = '{}.json'.format(env_name)
    req_cmd.py:19:        db_name = '{}.json'.format(env_name)
    scripts_cmd.py:13:        db_name = '{}.json'.format(env_name)
    statistics.py:13:        db_name = '{}.json'.format(env_name)

Also:
    consider flag in requirements
        a==1.2.3 ; sys_platform == "win32"  # flag those internally
        b==4.5.6 ; sys_platform != 'darwin'

Next Steps:
    - need to split JSONs by OS, then add transfer, merge and so on ...
    - update all:
    -   issue installing some NEW version, which requires NEW dependencies, that are not checked
    - yml/templates: yml/templates/<os>/conda_3.9.yml
    - yml_export (for server update)

    reproduce: install tensorflow, then uninstall
    look at: tensorflow-estimator, tensorflow-io-gcs-filesystem
    have: required_by: tensorflow, which does not exist any more

Add -package -uninstall X, Y, Z
    also remove all, that are only required_by X, Y, Z
